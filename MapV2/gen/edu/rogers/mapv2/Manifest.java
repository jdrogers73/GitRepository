 Permissions: All apps run in a separate security sandbox that includes certain default 
permissions. Any additional permission must be explicitly requested. This follows the least-privileges
philosophy to only give an app the permission it needs to do its job and no more. No application, 
by default, has permission to perform any operations that might adversely impact other applications, 
the operating system, or the user. 

The permission tag creates a permission that other apps must include in their manifest file as a 
"uses-permission" element if they want to use a feature of this app. The uses-permission tag requests 
another user to grant permission to use a system resource (android.permission) or 
app resource (packageName.permission) at install time. The user can then grant or deny permission. 
If permission is not given, 
the features that rely upon the resource will not work, but the user will usually not be notified. An 
entry will be made in the system log.
