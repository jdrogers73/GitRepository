<!-- a package groups classes with a common purpose as a form of documentation -->

<!-- versionName's only purpose is to show to users on the app store. -->

<!-- minSdkVersion is used by Google Play to determine which phone can download the app. Only phones
with a version equal to or higher than the minSdkVersion can see the app on the store. -->

<!-- targetedVersion is the highest version of Android on which the app has been tested. If the 
Android platform is greater than this value, Android may enable compatibility functions so the 
app continues to work as intended. Android versions are fully backward compatible.-->

<!-- The application element contains attributes applicable to the entire application. It also 
contains subelements for all the components of the application. -->
<!-- allowBackup determines whether or not the app's data and settings can be backed up and 
restored. Debugging mode allows all data to be copied off the device. -->
<!-- icon is the launcher icon displayed on the phone and the icon shown in the title bar -->
<!-- theme sets the theme for the application; a theme sets a consistent look for the entire app
Android will load the default theme. This attribute points to the styles.xml file which is an
empty file at creation, but can be modified with custom content -->
    
<!-- Permissions: All apps run in a separate security sandbox that includes certain default 
permissions. Any additional permission must be explicitly requested. This follows the least-privileges
philosophy to only give an app the permission it needs to do its job and no more. No application, 
by default, has permission to perform any operations that might adversely impact other applications, 
the operating system, or the user. 

The permission tag creates a permission that other apps must include in their manifest file as a 
"uses-permission" element if they want to use a feature of this app. The uses-permission tag requests 
another user to grant permission to use a system resource (android.permission) or 
app resource (packageName.permission) at install time. The user can then grant or deny permission. 
If permission is not given, 
the features that rely upon the resource will not work, but the user will usually not be notified. An 
entry will be made in the system log. -->

<!-- The purpose of a <uses-feature> declaration is to inform any external entity of the set of 
hardware and software features on which your application depends. The element offers a required 
attribute that lets you specify whether your application requires and cannot function without the 
declared feature, or whether it prefers to have the feature but can function without it. Because 
feature support can vary across Android devices, the <uses-feature> element serves an important 
role in letting an application describe the device-variable features that it uses. -->
<!-- You must specify each feature in a separate <uses-feature> element -->
<!-- Declared <uses-feature> elements are informational only, meaning that the Android system itself 
does not check for matching feature support on the device before installing an application.  -->
